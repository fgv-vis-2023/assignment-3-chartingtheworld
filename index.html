            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
              This project aims to provide effective data visualization for a wide range of indicators from around the world. The data used in this project is sourced from World Bank Data Indicators, which we obtained from <a href="https://github.com/light-and-salt/World-Bank-Data-by-Indicators">here</a>, and was processed using Python. Our visualization is created using D3 and ObservableHQ. You can access the notebook for the visualization <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/73cb3dcdc6d879de">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide two main visualizations: the <b>parallel coordinates graph</b> and the <b>choropleth map</b>. The parallel coordinates graph provides a comprehensive overview of the data, allowing users to view different combinations of columns and explore the relationships between them. The choropleth map provides a global view of the data, allowing users to easily identify and compare the value of one indicator across different countries.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="interactivity">
            <h2>The Interactivity</h2>
            <p>
              Our project aims to provide users with a functional, intuitive, and enjoyable experience. We offer a wide range of interactivity options to help users explore and gain insights from the data. Our goal is to provide answers to users' questions while also prompting new ones by presenting the data in a way that facilitates exploration and discovery. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To support this, we have designed the visualization in a way that enables users to answer various kinds of questions, such as "When?", "Where?", "How much?", "How does it compare?", "How does it relate?", "How does it vary?" and more. We provide the user with a range of options to interact with the data, including selecting the indicator, year, preferred map projection, and columns to visualize in the parallel coordinates graph. Users can also hover over countries on the choropleth map to see their values, and select a range of countries on the parallel coordinates graph to highlight them on the choropleth map. Additionally, hovering over a country in the choropleth map highlights it on the parallel coordinates graph.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following is a list of some of the interactive features we offer:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Selecting the indicator</li>
                <li>Selecting the year of interest with a slider</li>
                <li>Selecting the preferred map projection</li>
                <li>Selecting the columns to visualize in the parallel coordinates graph</li>
                <li>Hovering over countries in the choropleth map to see their values</li>
                <li>Selecting a range of countries on the parallel coordinates graph to highlight them on the choropleth map</li>
                <li>Hovering over a country in the choropleth map to highlight it on the parallel coordinates graph</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          
        <div class="map">
            <h2>
                The Map
            </h2>
            <p>
                The main focus of the page is, of course, the map, which is the visualization that will put the countries in geographic context and will provide the user with the most information. The map is a <b>choropleth map</b>, which means that the countries will be colored according to the value of the indicator in that country. The map will also provide the user with the possibility to select the year they want to see and the projection they prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Equal Earth projection is a relatively new map projection that was designed to address some of the shortcomings of other projections, particularly those that distort the sizes and shapes of landmasses. It was created by Bojan ≈†avriƒç, Tom Patterson, and Bernhard Jenny and is based on the Robinson projection, which was already a compromise projection intended to balance visual appeal with geographic accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key advantages of the Equal Earth projection is that it provides a more accurate representation of areas than many other projections, particularly in the high latitudes. This is because it preserves both area and shape while minimizing distortion, which means that the sizes and shapes of countries and continents are more accurately portrayed. This makes it a good choice for visualizations that aim to show global patterns or comparisons, particularly when it comes to geographic or spatial data.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our choropleth visualization, using the Equal Earth projection can help ensure that viewers can accurately interpret the values and patterns being shown, without being misled by distortions in the map. By presenting data on a map that is as accurate and faithful to reality as possible, it can provide a more reliable and informative representation of the data. Additionally, the Equal Earth projection has a visually pleasing and balanced appearance, which can help make the visualization more engaging and appealing to viewers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the Equal Earth projection, our project also offers an alternative way to visualize the data using a 3D, draggable globe. This option provides a more interactive and immersive way to explore the data, allowing users to rotate the globe to view different regions and countries in more detail.
            </p>
            <p> 
                One advantage of the globe option is that it provides a more intuitive and familiar way to explore the data and also focus the view on a particular region of the globe, like a continent filter. In this way, the variation of the data becomes more apparent in this region-context view. Additionally, the ability to rotate the globe allows users to engage with the visualization and can help the user absorb its information by doing it little by little instead of an all-at-once approach like the previous projection.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Overall, we believe that the 3D, draggable globe option provides a valuable addition to our project, offering users a unique and engaging way to explore the data and gain insights into global trends and patterns. However, we also chose to leave it as a second option so that users can use it only if they want to explore the data.
